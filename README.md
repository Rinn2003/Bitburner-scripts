# Disclaimer

This is my own personal repository of scripts for playing Bitburner. I mainly use it to track changes and bugs in my
scripts, and not as a means of providing scripts as a service to the game.

* Feel free to use my scripts, copy and/or edit them.
* If you think you encountered a bug, feel free to let me know!

Bitburner Discord has many awesome people willing to discuss many aspects of the game: https://discord.gg/Wjrs92b3
